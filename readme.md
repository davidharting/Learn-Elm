# Learning Elm ðŸŒ³

I am interested in learning more about [Elm](elm-lang.org).

I am just working through the official tutorials.

This also gave me a chance to play with Parcel. It "just works" out of the box with most everything I would use for SPAs. Super impressed with it so far!

## Development

This assumes you have `node 12.13.1` (or similar) installed. It also assumes `yarn` is globally installed within your Node.js.

1. `git clone https://github.com/davidharting/Learn-Elm.git && cd Learn-Elm`
1. `yarn`
1. `yarn start`
